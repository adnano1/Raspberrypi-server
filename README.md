# Raspberry Pi Server

This project sets up a basic server using a Raspberry Pi, enabling it to serve web content and handle various server-related tasks.

## Features

- Easy setup of a basic server environment on a Raspberry Pi.
- Lightweight and minimal configuration, perfect for small-scale server tasks.
- Configurable for different use cases, including hosting web applications or running automation tasks.

## Requirements

- A Raspberry Pi (any model, but Raspberry Pi 3 or later is recommended for better performance).
- Raspbian OS installed on the Raspberry Pi.
- Internet connection to install the required dependencies.
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations and network configuration.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone this repository onto your Raspberry Pi.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adnano1/Raspberrypi-server.git
   cd Raspberrypi-server
   ```

2. **Update System Packages:**

   Before installing any new packages, it's a good idea to update the existing system packages.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install necessary packages like `nginx`, `python`, or any other relevant software for your server.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install nginx python3 python3-pip
   ```

4. **Start the Server:**

   - For a web server setup using `nginx`:

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start nginx
     sudo systemctl enable nginx
     ```

   - For Python-based web applications, you can use `Flask`, `Django`, or any other web framework:

     Example using Flask:
     ```bash
     pip3 install Flask
     python3 app.py
     ```

5. **Configure the Server:**

   - You may need to configure `nginx` or set up a Python framework based on your requirements.
   - Ensure the server is accessible on your local network or the internet, depending on your use case.

## Project Structure

```bash
Raspberrypi-server/
├── app.py                # Example Python application
├── config/               # Configuration files (e.g., nginx, web apps)
├── scripts/              # Helper scripts for automation or setup
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Customization

- **Web Server**: The default configuration uses `nginx`, but you can replace or customize it according to your needs.
- **Python Applications**: If you plan to run a Python application, modify the `app.py` file or replace it with your own project.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that your Raspberry Pi has sufficient power and is connected to the internet.
- Use `systemctl` to check the status of services like `nginx`:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status nginx
   ```

- Check the logs for any errors:

   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```
